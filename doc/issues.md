# Issues

## General

- colors are slightly different from psx (map differently?)
- a few sfx are very loud and distorted (ex. warp sound, also when entering a bonus round)
- in some instances, game transitions occur too early (ex. game immediately jumps to win level screen when player lands on a warp platform, without playing either of crash's 'win level' animation sequences; some death sequences are cut short)
- main death sequence camera behavior is incorrect
- title sequence background images become too bright in some instances
- it is sometimes (but rarely) possible to jump in mid-air when beside walls
- demo mode does not function correctly
- attempting to enter any title state other than the map from the main menu ultimately results in the game entering an infinite loop and/or crashing
- compiling with optimization flags causes the game to behave differently (aside from performance improvements)
- tree change tracking implementation is broken

## Per-level

### Map

- camera is incorrect
- textures fail to load in some instances
- Moving around the map can cause the game to softlock

### N. Sanity Beach

### Jungle Rollers

### The Great Gate

### Boulders

### Upstream

### Rolling Stones

- falling pegs seem to be positioned slightly higher than Crash when Crash stands on them

### Papu Papu

### Hog Wild

- player dies after respawning at a checkpoint
- crash skips the 'look back at camera and then jump on hog' animation sequence that typically begins hog levels

### Native Fortress

### Up The Creek

### Ripper Roo

- Ripper Roo only makes a single jump before they disappear and restart their path

### The Lost City

- game crashes when attempting to kill lizards

### Temple Ruins

- approaching bats causes game to crash

### Road To Nowhere

### Boulder Dash

### Whole Hog
