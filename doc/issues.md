# Issues

## General

- colors are slightly different from psx (map differently?)
- a few sfx are very loud and distorted (ex. warp sound, also when entering a bonus round)
- main death sequence camera behavior is incorrect
- title sequence background images become too bright in some instances
- it is sometimes (but rarely) possible to jump in mid-air when beside walls
- demo mode does not function correctly
- attempting to enter any title state other than the map from the main menu ultimately results in the game entering an infinite loop and/or crashing
- tree change tracking implementation is broken
